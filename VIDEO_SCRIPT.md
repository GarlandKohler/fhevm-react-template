# Video Demonstration Script

This document outlines the content for the demo video showcasing the FHEVM SDK.

## Video Structure (10-15 minutes)

### 1. Introduction (1-2 min)

**On Screen**: Project title and overview

**Script**:
"Welcome to the FHEVM SDK demonstration. This project provides a universal, framework-agnostic SDK for building confidential applications with Fully Homomorphic Encryption. Let me show you why this matters and how easy it is to use."

**Show**:
- Project README
- Key features highlighted
- Architecture diagram

### 2. The Problem (1 min)

**Script**:
"Currently, building confidential dApps with FHE requires managing multiple scattered dependencies, understanding low-level encryption APIs, and writing lots of boilerplate code. Different frameworks need different approaches. This is time-consuming and error-prone."

**Show**:
- Example of complex, manual FHE setup
- Multiple import statements
- Verbose initialization code

### 3. The Solution (2 min)

**Script**:
"The FHEVM SDK solves this by providing a unified, simple API. Here's all you need to get started - less than 10 lines of code."

**Show**:
```typescript
import { createFhevmClient } from '@fhevm/sdk';

const client = await createFhevmClient({
  provider: new BrowserProvider(window.ethereum),
  network: 'sepolia'
});

const encrypted = await client.encryption.encryptU32(42, {
  contract: contractAddress,
  userAddress: signerAddress
});
```

**Highlight**:
- Simple import
- One-line initialization
- Clear API
- Type safety

### 4. SDK Architecture (2 min)

**Script**:
"The SDK is built with a modular architecture. At the core, we have the FhevmClient that manages everything. It includes an EncryptionService for encrypting values, a DecryptionService for decrypting with proper authorization, and helper utilities."

**Show**:
- Navigate through SDK source code
- Show key files:
  - `client.ts`
  - `encryption.ts`
  - `decryption.ts`
